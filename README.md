# Our World On Fire

See what others can't by using a simple and focused workflow that combines fire activity and imagery to discover affected areas using curated content from the [ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/browse/?q=fire#d=2&q=fire).

NOTE: the available dates in the thermal activity, burn areas, and imagery ***don't always match***.
One way in which this application helps overcome this issue is that it allows for you to inspect thermal activity at a location and then use the availble imagery to discover how that location has changed recently.

* Use the list of Active Burn Areas as a guide to zoom into specific locations.
* View recent changes at a location by using the list of available dates for the Sentinel-2 imagery.
* Additional layers (protected areas, population, and croplands) may provide context about the changes.
